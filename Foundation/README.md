## Overview ðŸ“šðŸ¦‘

Illex argentinus, the Argentine shortfin squid, represents a significant bioindicator species due to its commercial importance and its ability to bioaccumulate pollutants. This study focuses on temporal and tissue-specific contaminant patterns during the 2019â€“2021 period, which includes the COVID-19 lockdowns, a natural occurence affecting pollution levels


Project Scope and Objectives<br>

The project analyzes trace metals and organic compounds in squid tissues (muscle, liver, stomach, ink sac) to assess contamination levels, validate analytical methods, explore temporal trends, and evaluate human health risks in key consumption regions.<br>

ðŸ§ª Analytical Method Validation<br>

To ensure data reliability, trace metals were quantified using ICP-MS [(Instrument Parameters)](Methodology/Metals/Instrumnt_Param.pdf) with validation performed against Certified Reference Material (NIST CRM 1566b, Oyster Tissue) [(More information provided here)]([Methodology/Metals/Instrumnt_Param.pdf](https://tsapps.nist.gov/srmext/certificates/1566b.pdf)). External calibration [(See Calibration Ranges)](Methodology/Metals/Calib_Stand_Rangs.png) and recovery assessments confirmed method accuracy for metals such as Al, As, Se, and others (anonymized here as Metal_A, Metal_B, etc. for confidentiality).

Organic contaminants were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Although no compound-specific CRM is available for organic compounds in squid tissue, validation was based on adapted literature methods (Feo et al., 2020) and internal standards, with compounds anonymized (Organic_A, Organic_B, etc.).

Key Points:
Trace metals: CRM recovery confirmed accuracy; matrix digestion and instrument parameters rigorously controlled.
Organic compounds: Method validation adapted from literature; future work will focus on CRM acquisition and enhanced quantification metrics.
Some metal recoveries require further reassessment due to unusually high values.

Exploratory & Temporal Analysis

This research examines differences in contamination across tissues and years (2019â€“2021), highlights significant trends, and assesses potential human health risks through Estimated Daily Intake and Hazard Quotient metrics.

Why This Matters

By leveraging Illex argentinus as a sentinel species, this work provides critical insight into marine pollution dynamics in the SWAO, informing sustainable fisheries management and public health safeguards.
