# ü§ø Exploration Dashboard

## üìã Executive Summary

This dashboard continues the investigation into marine pollution in *Illex argentinus* by transitioning from method validation (Foundation Module) to exploratory data analysis. It focuses on uncovering patterns in contaminant concentrations across tissues, years, and biological traits ‚Äî while maintaining transparency about data limitations and simulation use.

Using simulated datasets resembling real observations (to preserve confidentiality), this dashboard applies correlation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, pollutant interaction analysis, and statistical testing to investigate pollutant behavior across 2019‚Äì2021.

Although the results are exploratory and not inferentially conclusive, this tool plays a key role in identifying leads for future hypothesis testing and risk assessment, while showcasing scalable analytical workflows in R Shiny.

## üìö Overview

*Illex argentinus*, the Argentine shortfin squid, serves as a bioindicator for marine pollution in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Between February and April (2019‚Äì2021), squid samples were analyzed for trace metals and organic contaminants. This dashboard serves as an interactive front-end to examine how these pollutants vary across:

- **Biological traits** (e.g., sex, size, maturity)
- **Environmental features** (e.g., capture month, distance to land)
- **Time** (e.g., pre-, mid-, and post-COVID sampling years)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Disclaimer:** Due to confidentiality agreements, all data shown in this dashboard are simulated. Variable names, values, and categories were anonymized or altered, but the structure mimics real datasets used in the original study.

## üß™ Dataset Schema

The project uses two datasets collected for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in R:  
> üìå To download: Right-click the link ‚Üí "Save link as..." ‚Üí If your browser tries to save it as a `.txt` file, simply rename the extension to `.csv` before saving.

- [`trace_metals.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Euchie23/SquidStack/main/Exploration/data/trace_metals.csv): Contains measurements of trace metal pollutants.
- [`organic_compounds.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Euchie23/SquidStack/main/Exploration/data/organic_compounds.csv): Contains measurements of organic compound pollutants.

Both datasets share 14 columns containing metadata such as sample ID, location, date, and biological measurements like length and weight. The remaining columns report analyte concentrations specific to each dataset type.

> üìù **Note:**  
> Columns labeled as `"int"` contain whole numbers, while `"num"` columns contain decimal (real) values. Some concentration columns are `"chr"` (character), indicating values flagged as **below the limit of quantification (BLOQ)**. These BLOQ indicators replace actual measurements. If a concentration column is `"num"`, all values were above the LOQ and are considered detected.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: Metal and organic compound names (e.g., Metal_A, Organic_B) are anonymized to maintain confidentiality.

## üéØ Exploratory Objectives

- üìÖ Examine temporal trends in pollutant concentrations (2019‚Äì2021)  
- ‚ö• Compare pollutant loads by sex and maturity status  
- üìè Investigate body size relationships with contaminant levels  
- üß™ Assess tissue-specific differences in accumulation  
- üìö Apply unsupervised learning (PCA & clustering) to identify hidden patterns  
- üåê Analyze pollutant co-occurrence via correlation matrices

## üß† Potential Insights to Explore

> üîé *These are exploratory hypotheses based on initial observations or existing literature. The dashboard allows users to investigate patterns interactively ‚Äî these are not confirmed conclusions.*

- Seasonal and size-based differences may be present across pollutant types  
- Cluster analysis could reveal meaningful groupings by tissue and year  
- Certain pollutants may appear to co-occur, suggesting shared sources or accumulation behavior  
- Organic compound variability might be higher, likely due to matrix effects or validation limitations  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: Only 7 out of 10 trace metals were validated, and none of the organic pollutants underwent full validation.
As such, caution is strongly advised when interpreting absolute concentration values, especially for organic compounds.
For more meaningful insights, consider focusing on relative differences or patterns (e.g., by tissue, season, or location) rather than direct numerical comparisons across analytes. <br>
