# 🦑📚 SquidStack — Interactive Dashboards for Marine Pollution & Risk Analysis

## 🌍 Real-World Value

SquidStack converts multi-year lab and field research into **actionable marine pollution intelligence**.  
These dashboards provide **decision-ready insights** on contamination patterns, ecological risks, and seafood safety in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean.

### Problem Statement
Marine ecosystems in the Southwest Atlantic are increasingly impacted by industrial and agricultural activity. Bioaccumulation of contaminants in *Illex argentinus* signals ecosystem stress and potential human health risk, yet stakeholders often lack tools to quickly identify trends, temporal patterns, or early warning signals.

### Decision Context
SquidStack dashboards enable **regulators, environmental agencies, fisheries managers, and public health teams** to:  
- Detect changes in contaminant levels over time  
- Assess ecological and human health implications  
- Prioritize monitoring, compliance, and mitigation efforts  
- Communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

## Overview 📚🃏

**SquidStack** is a modular collection of interactive dashboards built from my master's thesis at **National Taiwan University (2021–2024)**, focused on chemical contamination in *Illex argentinus* (Argentine shortfin squid).  

These dashboards translate field and lab research into **explorable insights**, supporting early detection of environmental stress and aiding evidence-based decision-making. 

> 🛂 **Note:** This repository hosts **public-facing dashboards only.** Full code history and extended modules are maintained in a private repository: `Squid_Fest`. To request access, [contact me](mailto:euchiejnpierre@gmail.com).

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

**Public modules use the following techniques for actionable insights:**

- **Dashboard Development:** R, Shiny, BS4Dash  
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** R (tidyverse, `qs`), Excel  
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Dunn’s test, Tukey HSD (`Exploration`)  
  - Spearman’s correlation (`Exploration`, `Fluctuation`)  
- **Time Series Modeling:** Regression lag analysis to detect bioaccumulation delays (`Fluctuation`)  
- **Human Health Risk Assessment:** Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Hazard Quotient (HQ) (`Risk Evaluation`)  
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, plotly, DT tables  

> Each tool is applied to **generate insights that support evidence-based decisions**.

## ⚠️ Data Confidentiality & Ethics

- All datasets are **simulated**, preserving real data structure.  
- **Pollutant names and sensitive variables are anonymized.**  
- Interpretations serve as **methodological demonstrations** rather than actual marine condition assessments.
