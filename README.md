# 🦑📚 SquidStack 📚🦑🃏📊📈

## Overview 📚🦑🃏

SquidStack is a curated version of a larger private repository **(Squid_Fest)** where the full version control and raw development occur. Its main purpose is for the development of interactive dashboards to present data workflows and explore results in an accessible, visual format. Updates are copied here from the Squid_Fest repo once polished [(Click here for  SquidStack update log)](CHANGELOG.md). 

**🛂This repository hosts the public-facing dashboards only. Active development and version control take place in a private repository (Squid_fest) to allow for faster iteration and maintainability. The private repo (squid_Fest) includes additional modules and in-progress work that may not yet be stable or documented, so if you would like access to the development history or full codebase please dont hesitate to contact me 🙂. 🛂.** 


### **🤨What is the Squid_Fest repository about?🤨**

Squid Fest is a data science portfolio that represents an extension and refinement of my graduate thesis work and interdisciplinary research conducted as a Master's student and Research Assistant at National Taiwan University (2021–2024). It investigates the contamination of Illex argentinus (Argentine shortfin squid) in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean to better understand regional marine pollution patterns, human health risks, and the impact of industrial activity—especially during the COVID-19 era. Then it goes on to  present a snapshot of applied research involving marine resource sustainability, ecosystem health, and data-driven fisheries science. <br>

This repository includes a few projects that define three core topics developed using a combination of ecological, biological, chemical, remote sensing, and industrial activity datasets, focused on *Illex argentinus* (Argentine shortfin squid) in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The projects demonstrate proficiency across a wide range of techniques including data engineering, statistical and machine learning modeling, and geospatial data fusion — with practical applications in marine ecology, environmental monitoring, and resource management. <br>

🎯 The overarching goals were to: <br>
 - Evaluate regional marine ecosystem health and the human health risk of major consumers
 - Analyze spatial and temporal squid catch patterns
 - Build predictive models to support sustainable fishery management <br>


## **⚠️Data Confidentiality Notice⚠️** 
**To comply with research confidentiality and ethical standards, the datasets used in this repository have been simulated to closely resemble the real-world data used in the thesis. Pollutant names and other sensitive variables were anonymized. The primary goal of these projects is to demonstrate analytical workflows, modeling techniques, and geospatial methodologies used during real research conducted at the National Taiwan University. As such, any interpretations or conclusions drawn from this repository should not be considered accurate representations of actual marine conditions in the study region.** <br><br>

 ### 🧠 Learning Note <br>
This Squid_Fest portfolio reflects skills developed and applied over several months of focused, self-directed study and hands-on practice. While these tools and techniques are still being refined, the work demonstrates a solid and growing proficiency in applying data science to complex ecological problems with real-world relevance. <br> <br>

🔧 Tools, Techniques & What I Learned <br>
This project involved a multidisciplinary tech stack and data science pipeline. Below are the tools and methods that powered the analyses — and the skills I developed throughout:
 - Data Engineering: Built ETL pipelines in R/Python, SQL-based structuring
 - Modeling: GAMs, Tweedie GLMs, Population Dynamics Model, AutoML
 - Geospatial Analytics: NetCDF integration, PostGIS querying, QGIS mapping
 - Dashboards: Shiny, Streamlit; parameterized EDI/HQ tools for stakeholders
 - Visualization: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
 - Programming & Productivity: R, Python, PostgreSQL, Bash, Git, Excel (VBA)

## 🐙🎉 😀 Join the Party: Collaborators, Learners, reviewers & Ocean Data Nerds Welcome 😀

Although the thesis has wrapped, the research, methods, and questions are far from over. This space is designed for:

- Researchers and students interested in trace metals, organic contaminants, and cephalopod toxicology
- Data scientists looking to dive into environmental monitoring datasets and risk modeling
- Collaborators with fresh ideas on improving analytical workflows, dashboards, or comparative studies
- Anyone curious about bioindicators, marine ecology, or the impacts of COVID-19 on pollution patterns

Whether you're here to refine methodologies, expand detection scopes, share knowledge or consumption data, or just learn more about environmental analytics — you're invited.

Open an issue, fork the repo, suggest a better calibration model, or just vibe with the data. Let’s build something better together.
